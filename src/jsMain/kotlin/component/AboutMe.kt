                Experienced developer with a well developed knowledge in Android, app development in general and app architecture. 
                Using the latest and greatest technology is something I am passionate about. 
                I work best where I can have an overview of the project, its progress and its communication with stakeholders to ensure my team delivers a quality product within the deadline.  
                Iâ€™m comfortable in the role as tech lead - with responsibilities such as: 
                managing tech interview for potential future hires; 
                planning, estimating and prioritising work regarding technical debt and adapting to new technologies; 
                sharing knowledge.
